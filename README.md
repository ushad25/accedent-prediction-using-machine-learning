### **🌟 Overview**  
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting road accidents based on driver behavior, traffic conditions, and vehicle-related factors. The results can help authorities implement targeted safety measures to reduce road accident rates effectively.  

---

### **📊 Dataset**  
**Source**: Accident dataset with traffic, driver, and vehicle-related features.  
**Key Features**:  
- Traffic Density  
- Speed Limit  
- Number of Vehicles  
- Driver Alcohol Consumption  
- Driver Age  
- Driver Experience  

**Target Variable**:  
- `Accident` (0 = No Accident, 1 = Accident)
